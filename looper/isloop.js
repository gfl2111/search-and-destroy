// Complete the function isLoop, which will determine if a list contains a loop. It should return true if a loop exists and false if it does not. You can assume the values of each node in the linked list are unique. You may not mutate any nodes on the list.

//Complete this algo
const isLoop = (linkedlist) => {
    let tail = linkedList.tail
    if tail.
};

// Set 2 pointers, look at 1st two values
// If the 2nd node we've been checking is the name, we know we've hit a loop

/*
EXTRA CREDIT:

Write a function findLoop() that consumes a linkedlist with a loop
This function should return the Node value the loop begins at
Remember to write some test specs too!
